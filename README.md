# Project Title
Loggers


# Description
Loggers is a modified logging package that is designed to be flexible and modular.
The package is designed to be used in a generic python project as a way to handle run logs in a
sophisticated and organized way.

Logger: creates and manages logging instances and handlers at a high level

LogParse: parses log files for errors

PerformanceLogger: tracks program performance (execution time)


# Challenges
- instance versus class attribute management
- deciding allocation of class versus instance methods
- test development


# Dependencies
- logging
- os
- typing


# Logger Usage
Import Logger class:
from loggers import Logger

Set the overall run name at the top level of your program.
Use this as the very first import to exforce across instances
Logger.set_run_name(run_name)

Create Logger instane:
logger = Logger(logger_name)

Add join or remove handlers:
logger.add_console_handler(handler_name)
logger.add_file_handler(handler_name: str = 'main')
logger.join_handler(other_logger_name, handler_name)
logger.remove_hanler(handler_name)

Use logger as normal
logger.debug(message)
logger.info(message)
logger.warning(message)
logger.error(message)
logger.critical(message)

Set message levels at a high level using _instances After importing other modules
Logger[logger_name]: {dict of all initialized loggers from sub modules}
Logger.loggers() = [list of logger names]
logger_instance = Logger[logger_name]
logger_instance.set_handler_level(handler_name, level)

Clear log files
logger.clear_todays_logs()
logger.clear_all_logs()
